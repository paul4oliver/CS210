# Cplusplus-Program

•Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

  This project calculates the compound interest of an investment over time with criteria that is set by the person using the application. The problem that this program solves is the mathematical calculation that computes how interest a person can expect to accrue during any given period of time in years. This calculation is not always simple and can expel a burden that is relevant to most peoples’ lives. This program also encourages healthy saving habits by showing the person using the program how monthly contributions impact their overall balance versus only the initial investment. 
  
•	What did you do particularly well?

  I believe I was able to utilize methods well to make the calculations. I also felt that I was able to keep my code more organized to improve readability in case I decide to expand the functionality of the code in the future. 

•	Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

  I think that improvements in the class initialization and structure could improve and enhance my code. I feel that I am able to create a program that can execute the desired function, but that I am not utilizing available tools to their maximum potential. As a new programmer, I know there is much more to learn and that fuels my drive.
  
•	Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

  Some of the most challenging code to write was the border surrounding text and code the involved the user interface. This project allowed me to explore the functionality of setfill() better than I have in the past. Frequent testing to see how adjustments affected the appearance were critical to overcome this challenge. 

•	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

  The skills from this project that will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work are organization and the utilization of functions. I expect to continue developing these skills throughout my learning experience at SNHU and well into my career. I like how functions and organization are relevant to one another in code. 

•	How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by including minimal code in main and by separating my class function declarations from their definitions. An important lesson throughout this course was to write for your audience and to be considerate. Keeping code maintainable, readable, and adaptable benefits everyone and promotes a healthy work ethic. 
  
  Thank you, Professor Chan, for your guidance during this course.
